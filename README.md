# MediaUploader
A Sprint Boot Project to Upload MP3 Files and Extract and Store Any Meta Data in an in memory H2 database.  Uses the Apache Tika library version 1.17 to parse out meta data from the *.mp3 files.

Creates REST style webservice URLs to upload and view meta data on *.mp3 files.

To install the webservice project through maven from the root directory:
mvn clean install

To run the webservice project: (spins up a local Tomcat server connected to the in memory H2 database)
java -jar target/MediaInfo-WebService-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

To make an example api call:
curl -H "Accept: application/json" 'http://localhost:8080/api/mediainfos'
or
curl -H "Accept: application/xml‚Äù 'http://localhost:8080/api/mediainfos/1'

Go directly to the mediainfos url in a browser to view all files uploaded:
http://localhost:8080/api/mediainfos

Or go directly to the webservice homepage to upload and view all uploads at:
http://localhost:8080/

The max upload filesize is 128KB (configurable via src/main/resources/application.properties)
The only acceptable format is *.mp3
